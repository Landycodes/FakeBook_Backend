# FakeBook Backend
A backend server for a social media app using express.js for routing and mongoDB for the database

 ## Description 
 MongoDB is a NOSQL database used in this application to store, update and delete data such as Users, thoughts, friends, and reactions!
 All routes have been tested using Insomnia. You can retrieve all users or a single user, create a new user, update a user, or delete a user.
 You can also Create, Read, Update, and Destroy thoughts similair to users! Also you can friend two users together and unfriend them Aswell
 as create reactions to thoughts and delete those reactions!

  ## NOTE
  At 9:10 minutes in the video I put the users ID instead of the username. both instances will work but the proper input would be the actual
  username
